##Codification Of Freight Wagons

Wagons dedicated for Cts and SB transport in CT are to be marked with a letter C as wagon compatibility code **(WWC)** or and eventually additional plate or a plate with correction number **(WCD)** (in accordance with bi-/multilateral agreements). Other types of wagons suitable for these loading units include flat wagons with spigots and flat wagons with wooden floors.
Semitrailers, non-powered road vehicles which are transported by rail loaded on fixed-recess wagons (pocket wagons) are to be marked with P wagon compatibility code.
