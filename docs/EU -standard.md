## European Industry Standard##

Virtually most of the European Union has the codification of railway gauges implemented, whereas Polish IMs network does not. RUs still must apply for exceptional permission to run intermodal trains, under conditions that are not specified in some commonly available decision or a guideline. IM’s Railway lines are constantly being examined for the conditions of carriage on paths requested by RUs. Each RU receives permits for requested paths. These permits have various numbers and defined validity. Two types of permits are available. One permit type serves for the “standard” transport units network permit. The other type is applied for an individual path proving requests for “non-standard” units. In IM instruction it is not specified which transportation units are “standard” and “nonstandard.”

Combined Transport Codification makes RUs and IMs operations simpler because its rules differ from these applied for the exceptional transports. Only non-codified ITUs are to be examined and approved under the current exceptional transport rules,
Recently, a number of new types of hybrid loading units have been appearing on the market, with enlarged sizes in relation to the ISO standard. For these hybrid units IM can also create and verify IM exceptional consignment Profiles conditions in addition to the combined transport profiles. For the time being, the manager has expressed no interest in simplifying the rules and is not open for a dialogue with RUS.
##Understanding the Specifics of Codification in Combined Transport##
Codification in Combined Transport (CT) refers to a system used for the identification and presentation of information about various elements involved in the transport process. The codification system is crucial for efficient operations, documentation handling, involved elements control, and smooth communications in CT.
