#Railway Lines Codification in Poland – Mission Impossible#
##Introduction##
In Poland we have almost 123 passenger and freight Railway Undertakings **(RU)**. In 2023 out of all freight RUs in Poland twenty-six of them executed intermodal transports. RUs run these transports on exceptional rules. The alternative to the currently binding rules is to introduce Combined Transport **(CT)** rules in Poland. CT is an intermodal transport governed by EU Directive and UIC CT rules, where a major part of the journey is made by rail, inland waterways or sea, and the initial and final legs carried out by road are as short as possible.
##Poland - Current Status##
The Infrastructure Manager’s **(IM)** Instruction **Ir-10** Instructions on the carriage of exceptional consignments on 1435 mm track contains the term "Intermodal" occurs five times in the context of Intermodal Loading Units **(ILUs)** two definitions, consignment control protocol exemption and an additional provision for a template for an exceptional transport approval.

For each one of the terms: "container", "swap body", "semi-trailer" we find one occurrence in the context of ILU definition. Similarly, term "articulated wagon" occurs once in the context of axels distance. Terms like pocket (wagon), profile, codification or codified, and hybrid (loading unit) do not appear in the manual.

My experience is that RUs and terminal operators as well as shippers need some information where it is clearly stated what is allowed and what is not allowed, depending on the 3 elements: of the rail transport, namely a wagon, an Intermodal Loading Unit (ILU) and an applied IMs path.

In May 2023 in the IM premises, during a meeting of Rail Council the topic of the need for railways codification in Poland in the context of railway digitalisation and simplified procedures is needed, was raised again. It was suggested and requested by representative of a RU: “Would it not make sense to form a working group on the topic of codification.” At present it is the case that each RU having the same ILU as another RU can report it to the IM with completely different critical points describing ILU. It is enough that in the application for carriage conditions one carrier adds a lateral loading tolerance to the actual dimensions and other RU does not, even though they are handing over the same load, on the same wagon type. Months passed and the working group was not formed.

## European Industry Standard##

Virtually most of the European Union has the codification of railway gauges implemented, whereas Polish IMs network does not. RUs still must apply for exceptional permission to run intermodal trains, under conditions that are not specified in some commonly available decision or a guideline. IM’s Railway lines are constantly being examined for the conditions of carriage on paths requested by RUs. Each RU receives permits for requested paths. These permits have various numbers and defined validity. Two types of permits are available. One permit type serves for the “standard” transport units network permit. The other type is applied for an individual path proving requests for “non-standard” units. In IM instruction it is not specified which transportation units are “standard” and “nonstandard.”
Combined Transport Codification makes RUs and IMs operations simpler because its rules differ from these applied for the exceptional transports. Only non-codified ITUs are to be examined and approved under the current exceptional transport rules,
Recently, a number of new types of hybrid loading units have been appearing on the market, with enlarged sizes in relation to the ISO standard. For these hybrid units IM can also create and verify IM exceptional consignment Profiles conditions in addition to the combined transport profiles. For the time being, the manager has expressed no interest in simplifying the rules and is not open for a dialogue with RUS.
##Understanding the Specifics of Codification in Combined Transport##
Codification in Combined Transport (CT) refers to a system used for the identification and presentation of information about various elements involved in the transport process. The codification system is crucial for efficient operations, documentation handling, involved elements control, and smooth communications in CT.

Carriage in CT involves running of coded intermodal transport units (ITUs) on special carrier wagons in trains subject to an agreement; these trains have a maximum profile number and run on approved lines subject to a special examination by IMs. If just one of this three elements fails to be codified, then instead of CT we deal with the exceptional consignment transport regime.
##Codification of railway lines##
IM determines the Combined Transport Profile (CTP) of a section of line. IM decides whether CTPs are calculated either based on the structure gauge proximity calculation or on the characteristics of exact position of the obstacles on the inspected section of line. When the codification is based on the physical position of obstacles, which in practice is beyond the calculated limits of the gauge, the physical position of obstacles is determined by field measurements. A line CTP consists of one or more letters followed by one or more numbers of 2 or 3 digits:
##Codification of ILU##
ILU is loading which is suitable for intermodal transport on road, rail and inland waterways or sea. It is a synonym of ITU (Intermodal Transport Unit) as defined in the “Glossary for transport statistics.” Most popular ILUs are Containers, Swap Bodies including some hybrid loading units. Semi-Trailers (vertical transhipment) and Roller Units (horizontal handling are less commonly transported by rail.
Containers and swap bodies are allocated a C code number describing a loading unit height module depending on their dimensions. Class 1 containers according to ISO 668 do not require a code number plate. They can be transported in CT on the basis of the dimensions code C in accordance with UIC Loading Guidelines Volume 2. Other containers and swap bodies require C code number and if these loading units have a code number plate, only information of this code number plate shall be considered. Roller bodies are allocated a B code number. Semi-Trailers are allocated a P code number.
##Codification Of Freight Wagons##
Wagons dedicated for Cts and SB transport in CT are to be marked with a letter C as wagon compatibility code **(WWC)** or and eventually additional plate or a plate with correction number **(WCD)** (in accordance with bi-/multilateral agreements). Other types of wagons suitable for these loading units include flat wagons with spigots and flat wagons with wooden floors.
Semitrailers, non-powered road vehicles which are transported by rail loaded on fixed-recess wagons (pocket wagons) are to be marked with P wagon compatibility code.

##Technical Number##
The technical number is attributed to an ILU. It is a combination of the wagon compatibility code (WCC) and the Combined Transport Profile number (CTP no.) (e.g. **C45**, **P400**)

##CT Train Operational Rules##
Each RU is obliged to run route compatibility check in line with TSI OPE Appendix D1.
The compatibility check includes control and comparison of:
The (CT code) of the loaded freight wagon which is results from the combination of the Technical Number of the ILU and, for the freight wagon, of the Wagon Compatibility Code and Wagon Correction Digit where necessary, and the Combined Transport Profile of the line on the other side.

##Summary##
The above-mentioned elements of the Combined Transport are rough approximations of this complex industry concept. A more detailed look at the principles of CT goes beyond the purpose of this article. It is possible that the topic will be pursued further in future dissertations.
